# Loop-Checker

This Python program demonstrates the use of **for loops** with both numeric ranges and strings, along with printing multiple lines inside loops.

---

## üìå What It Does

- Uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 0 to 9.
- Prints multiple statements inside the loop to show how loop bodies execute.
- Prints a newline after each iteration for clarity.
- After finishing the numeric loop, prints a message indicating the loop ended.
- Uses another `for` loop to iterate over each character in the string `"Hello"` and prints each character individually.

---

## üß† How It Works

1. The first loop iterates over numbers 0 to 9:
   - Prints the current number.
   - Prints two additional messages.
   - Prints a blank line for separation.
2. Prints "End loop" after the first loop finishes.
3. The second loop iterates over each character in the string `name = "Hello"` and prints each character on its own line.
